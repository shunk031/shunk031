His research interests include deep learning-based natural language processing, computer vision, medical image processing, and computational advertising.\nMy personality traits can be summarized as follows:\n Love research and development. I am enjoying research life, and I am currently conducting three research topics simultaneously, e.g., natural language processing, medical image based computer vision, computational advertising. Every day read and implement the cutting-edge deep learning models from research paper. I have released many re-implementations of models using mainly Chainer and PyTorch. Therefore, based on state-of-the-art cases, I can advise on deep learning base product design. High technical communicativity. Summarize what I made and what I studied, and spread suchinformation. This shows that I can input and output regularly.
